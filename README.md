Cleaned the Dataset like looking out for duplicate rows, empty rows, errors.
Then proceeded to formating the dates column to the right date format, the time and the whole dataset into a table.
Used the "If" function when trying to etract the time interval, and days of the week for the insights. 
Made use of the Pivot Table to summarize the data and make it easier for visualization.
In the coure of using the pivot table, "mean, max, min, percentage, sum, average" were used to get certain insights. There are different pivot tables with different titles in the file pivot tables like year and revenue on different columns respectfully but same table.
From the pivot table, pivot charts were gotten and put together to form a dashboard.
On a different work sheet named "Pizza Dashboard" all the charts were arranged in the dashboard and slicers were connected to the charts for 'data story-telling'. 
The dashboard color theme is Green, different shades of green were used to make the visualization easy and attractive to end users.
